# m5stack-atoms3r-components

ESPHome components for the M5Stack AtomS3R

## esphome Configuration
You will need to create a `secrets.yaml` file with the following content, to be able to use esphome CLI:
```
wifi_ssid:     <your wifi ssid>
wifi_password: <your wifi password>

wifi_ap_name:     <your ap name>
wifi_ap_password: <your ap password>

homeassistant_api_key: <HomeAssistant generated API key>

ota_password: <your OTA password>
```

## Visual Studio Code Setup

Run the `setup.bat` to set up a local virtual python environment to run the `esphome.exe` in. Afterwards you can either run `esphome` commands manually via Terminal/Shell, e.g. `esphome config .\m5stack-atom-s3r.yaml`, or you can make use of the pre-configured Visual Studio tasks (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>, Tasks: Run Task).

### Note on SVG / Cairo
For SVG (`image:` in YAML-config) images to work, you need Cairo (see `requirements.txt`). Cairo unfortunately is a bit finicky on Windows, to get it to work you will need some additional steps:

1. Download GTK binaries via https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild > Release
2. Copy the cairo* files from `/bin` to the Python virtual environment (`.venv/Scripts/`)
